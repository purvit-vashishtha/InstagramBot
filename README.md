Instagram Bot created with Python3 and environment used was Spyder.

# Structure:
1. [Auto_Message_Bot](https://github.com/purvit-vashishtha/InstagramBot/tree/Main/Auto_Message_Bot): Bot which is responsible for Automating Text Messages to different users by entering your own username and password. This python code is completely secure and private to you only and doesnot reveal passwords to any other sources.

#Requirements:

1. Selenium: It is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others. I personally prefer Python as itâ€™s very easy to write code in python. A browser-driver then executes these scripts on a browser-instance on your device. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
`pip install selenium`

2. webdriver-manager: It provides a way to automatically manage drivers for different browsers. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
`pip install webdriver-manager`

3. ChromeDriver: ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome.

4. Google Chrome
